# face_swapping
CIS 581 final project 

Requirements:

Python 2.7
OpenCV 3
Numpy
Scipy
face_recognition

Instructions:

Run main.py after setting SOURCE_PATH for source video and TARGET_PATH for target video.
Set frame rate for swap, for other frames we use optical flow for estimation.

For Multiple Frame Video Matching, run mainMultipleFrames.py after setting SOURCE_PATH and TARGET_PATH inside it.

For Single Video Multiple Face Swap, run main.py after setting the same video in both SOURCE_PATH and TARGET_PATH.
